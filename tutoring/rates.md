> [!NOTE]
> Group sessions are different. While the tutees don't get one on one tuition, I believe small groups can be excellent environments for teaching. These may be good for overview lessons, homework sessions and out-of-syllabus further learning.



> [!CAUTION]
> These rates are subject to change. If they will be changed, all current tutees will be notified in good time.
